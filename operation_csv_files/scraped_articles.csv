Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Zelensky's conciliatory letter to Trump suggests he's out of options,2025-03-05,James Waterhouse,"Whether Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky's decision to patch up relations with his US counterpart Donald Trump is wise depends on who you ask in Ukraine. ""A very bad decision,"" remarked blogger and army serviceman Yuriy Kasyanov, who thinks the US ""won't help Ukraine with anything"" after this mineral deal is signed. ""The president behaved with dignity"" said former MP Boryslav Bereza, who described Zelensky's softening of tone as an ""apology"". Last night, Ukraine's leader gave his evening address from the courtyard outside Kyiv's Presidential Office. It was the same spot where he gave the now famous ""we are all here"" speech with his cabinet on the second day of Russia's invasion. Back then, he'd turned down offers to leave. Many in the West expected Russia to be in the capital within days, with the president being captured or killed. Three years on, it seems his choice to keep fighting has gradually been taken away from him. He said he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" and that it was ""time to make things right"". Washington's hostile rhetoric, that Oval Office meeting and the ""pausing"" of US military aid have forced him to bend to Trump's peace vision. Up until last week, Zelensky had held firm that Ukraine would only agree to peace if its security was guaranteed, otherwise it would fight on. He also accused Trump of living in a ""disinformation space"" after the US president repeated some of Moscow's claims. All of this served as a prelude to Friday's fiery exchange with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, who accused Zelensky of having ""disrespected"" the US and ultimately told him to leave. The Ukrainian leader had a warmer reception from European leaders at the weekend - but while they pledged to help secure Ukraine in the future, they made clear peace would still require US involvement. Then, on Tuesday, Trump paused US military aid to Ukraine, raising concerns it may only be able to hold out for a matter of months - and leaving Zelensky to make his peace with the situation. In a letter to the US president, he even gave specifics on what the first stage of a peace process could involve, including a naval and aerial ceasefire - proposals first suggested by France's President Emmanuel Macron over the weekend. Trump said he appreciated the letter, in a sign of cooling tensions between the two leaders, and that Zelensky had agreed to strike a peace deal. What is more telling is Zelensky's willingness now to sign a mineral deal without the security guarantees he is hoping for - and had portrayed as essential until very recently. The US has suggested the presence of US companies mining for natural resources would be enough to put Russia off breaking a ceasefire. However, American businesses didn't exactly put Moscow off from launching its full-scale invasion. What's even more telling are the lack of compromises Russia would seemingly have to make in any peace agreement. Perhaps Zelensky has run out of political road, and with his European allies acknowledging that they still need the US, Washington seems still to be the only place for him to turn to.

AIB posts record €2.7bn pre-tax profit,2025-03-05,John Campbell,"AIB, one of Ireland's two main banks, made a record pre-tax profit of €2.7bn (£2.2bn) in 2024, up 13% on the previous year. The Irish state continues to own a 12% stake in the bank as a legacy of a bail-out during the financial crisis. The bank's chief executive, Colin Hunt, said there was now ""a clear path"" to a return to full private ownership this year. Last week AIB's main rival, Bank of Ireland, reported an annual pre-tax profit of €1.9bn (£1.6bn). The two banks have benefitted from higher interest rates, a strong domestic economy and a relative lack of competition. AIB said new mortgage lending in Ireland was up 14% to €4.5bn (£3.8bn) and reflected a mortgage market share of 36%. The bank has a small operation in the UK, including seven branches in Northern Ireland. Profit at AIB UK was down 40% from £197m to £116m, largely as a result of an increase in the amount of money set aside to cover the impact of bad loans. These impairment charges increased from £33m to £76m. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Zelensky vows to 'make things right' with Trump and negotiate peace,2025-03-04,Jacqueline Howard,"Volodymyr Zelensky said he was ready to work under Donald Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace days after their explosive Oval Office meeting. The Ukrainian president described the White House showdown as ""regrettable"" in a lengthy social media post in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. ""We are ready to work fast to end the war, and the first stages could be the release of prisoners and truce in the sky – ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure – and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same,"" he wrote. ""Then we want to move very fast through all next stages and to work with the US to agree a strong final deal."" In his social media post, Zelensky said Friday's meeting ""did not go the way it was supposed to be"", adding: ""It is regrettable that it happened this way,"" he wrote. ""It is time to make things right. We would like future co-operation and communication to be constructive."" He also reiterated that Ukraine was ready to sign a minerals deal with the US, after the failure to do so at the Washington meeting. Ukraine woke to the news on Tuesday that the US was ""pausing and reviewing"" its military aid to the country after a breakdown in diplomacy last week. In his post, Zelensky offered an overt declaration of gratitude for the help the US has so far given to his country. ""We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence,"" he wrote. ""And we remember the moment when things changed when President Trump provided Ukraine with Javelins. We are grateful for this,"" he added, referring to the US anti-tank missile system sold to Ukraine during Trump's first administration. During Friday's meeting in the Oval Office, Vice-President JD Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for the military support the US had provided. ""Have you said 'thank you' once this entire meeting?"" Vance said, before Trump told Zelensky he was not being ""very thankful"". Zelensky defended himself in the meeting, and began an interview with Fox News in the hours afterwards, saying: ""I'm very thankful to Americans for all your support."" The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War III"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal – Trump told Zelensky ""come back when you're ready for peace"". Trump is due to deliver an address to Congress later on Tuesday, during which the Reuters news agency reports he plans to announce a minerals deal between US and Ukraine has been signed. A number of Ukraine's allies have commented on the latest from the Ukrainian president, including UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who welcomed Zelensky's ""steadfast commitment to securing peace"". It is ""vital that all parties worked towards a lasting and secure peace for Ukraine as soon as possible"", a statement from No 10 said. Likewise, French President Emmanuel Macron praised Zelensky's willingness to ""re-engage in dialogue"" with Trump, the Elysee Palace said. Days before his meeting with Zelensky, the US President had met with Macron, who travelled to Washington with a warning to Trump: ""You can't be weak in the face of Putin."" While European leaders rallied behind Zelensky following the clash, Nato's secretary general advised the Ukrainian leader to ""find a way"" to restore his relationship with Trump. Speaking to the BBC the following day, Mark Rutte said he had told him ""we have to respect"" what Trump has done for Ukraine so far. Zelensky's statement falls short of an apology to Trump, which those in the US president's camp had called for. In Moscow, Vladimir Putin's team earlier welcomed the US's pause to military aid as likely to be the ""best"" contribution to peace. ""If the US stops, or pauses these supplies, this will probably be the best contribution to the cause of peace,"" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg. Trump himself has not commented on the pause to aid, nor Zelensky's response, however he did earlier berate the Ukrainian leader following his meetings with European allies at the weekend. A Sunday summit - hosted by the UK prime minister - was intended as a show of support for Ukraine. After the meeting, Zelensky said a deal to end the war between Ukraine and Russia was ""still very, very far away"". Trump described this as the ""worst statement that could have been made by Zelensky"", in a post on his Truth Social platform. ""It is what I was saying, this guy doesn't want there to be peace as long as he has America's backing,"" the president wrote. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Boy taken to hospital after primary school stabbing,2025-03-04,,"Gardaí (Irish police) are investigating after a boy was stabbed by another child at a primary school in north Dublin. The incident, which happened on Tuesday, involved a knife, BBC News NI understands. Both children involved attend the school, gardaí said. The child is understood to be 11 years old, Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported. He was taken to a Dublin hospital's intensive-care unit for treatment and has been described as having serious, non-life threatening injuries. Gardaí said they are liaising with school management and staff with a view to identifying the circumstances around the incident. It is not being treated as a criminal investigation due to the ages of the children involved. In the Republic of Ireland, the minimum age of responsibility in most cases is 12. The Irish education department confirmed its psychological service is providing support to staff and the school community. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance. Romanians on both sides of the political spectrum seem unconvinced. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"".

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""

Germany's Merz promises to do 'whatever it takes' on defence,2025-03-05,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz, who's expected to become Germany's next chancellor, has announced a political deal to raise hundreds of billions of euros in extra spending on defence and infrastructure. ""In view of the threats to our freedom and peace on our continent, the rule for our defence now has to be 'whatever it takes',"" he said. Merz, whose conservatives won Germany's election last month, said he and his likely coalition partners from the centre left would put new proposals to parliament next week. He has spoken of a need for urgency on German spending in light of ""recent decisions by the American government"". Merz, 69, did not elaborate but he has been outspoken in his criticism of President Donald Trump's treatment of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office. Earlier this week he said European leaders had to show ""we are in a position to act independently in Europe"". At a news conference on Tuesday, alongside leaders from the Social Democrats and his conservative sister party in Bavaria, Merz said Germany was counting on the US to stand by ""mutual alliance commitments... but we also know that the resources for our national and alliance defence must now be significantly expanded"". Merz said, in English, he would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect freedom and peace - a reference to Mario Draghi's vow to save the euro in 2012 when he was European Central Bank president. At the heart of his proposals is a special €500bn (£415bn) fund to repair Germany's creaking infrastructure, as well as loosening stringent budget rules to allow investment in defence. In the wake of Europe's financial crisis, Germany imposed a ""debt brake"" or Schuldenbremse, limiting the budget deficit to 0.35% of national economic output (GDP) in normal times. The new defence proposal recommends that ""necessary defence spending"" above 1% of GDP should be exempt from debt brake restrictions, with no upper limit. Although Germany has provided more aid to Ukraine than any other European country, its military is notoriously underfunded. Olaf Scholz's Social Democrat-led government set up a €100bn fund after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, but most of that has already been allocated. Germany will have to find an extra €30bn a year just to meet the current Nato target of 2% of GDP on defence, and security experts believe it will need to raise its target closer to 3%. Scholz was due to meet Friedrich Merz and Social Democrat leaders on Wednesday on the eve of an EU summit devoted to Ukraine and European defence. His government fell apart late last year because the three parties in coalition could not agree to reforming debt restrictions. The debt brake has been written into Germany's constitution, or Basic Law, and any change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament, which is not a foregone conclusion because of the large number of seats held by the far-right AfD and the Left party. However, the new parliament will not convene until late March and this measure will initially go before the old parliament. Boris Pistorius, the Social Democrat defence minister in the outgoing government, said the spending plans were a ""big, important step"" even if they were far from being a coalition deal. Ten days after Germany's elections, the parties are taking part in exploratory talks, which continue on Thursday. Pistorius told German TV that removing defence from national debt rules was not about armaments as much as ""the security of our country - nothing more, nothing less"". Social Democrat leader Lars Klingbeil, standing alongside Merz on Tuesday, gave details of the plan to re-invest in German infrastructure, saying: ""Our country is wearing itself out."" Loans of €500bn would go into a fund to cover repairs to roads, railways and other critical infrastructure; €100bn of the money would go to Germany's 16 federal states, with a loosening of the debt brake to allow the states to rack up small amounts of debt too.

Romanians on the march after arrest of far-right presidential favourite,2025-03-05,Nick Thorpe,"Tens of thousands of Romanians marched on Bucharest's Victory Square, the seat of the Romanian government, at the weekend, after the presidential election favourite was taken in for questioning. Calin Georgescu was picked up on his way to register as a candidate, and he was later charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order, as well as membership of a neo-fascist organisation. ""Georgescu's mentality is the same as the mentality of Trump,"" said Lavinia approvingly, as she steered her three-year-old daughter's pushchair through a sea of Romanian tricolour flags. ""He will listen to our opinion, just as we listen to him. We came here today for freedom, and democracy."" On the day of Georgescu's arrest came an unexpected twist. Guns, grenade launchers, and gold bullion buried beneath the floorboards were found in raids on 47 properties by Romanian police targeting a network, allegedly run by a former French legionnaire and militia chief in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Horatiu Potra's current whereabouts are unknown, but his alleged links to Georgescu have only added to the intrigue. While Horatiu Potra has admitted to illegal possession of weapons, Georgescu has denied all wrongdoing. In just three months, Romania has gone from a stable and loyal member of the European Union and Nato, to a country where a far-right, pro-Russia figure has come from almost nowhere to become favourite for the presidency. Georgescu led the first round of last December's election, but the run-off vote was then annulled after Romanian intelligence revealed Russia had been involved in 800 TikTok accounts backing him. The election is being rerun on 4 and 18 May. For Georgescu's critics, photographs of the weapons cache are the ultimate proof of his danger to the republic. For his supporters, they're the latest bout of mud-slinging, the doomed attempt of a corrupt regime to resist inevitable, Trump-inspired change. At the roadside, a lone busker played the same tune over and over again on an electric piano, as a sea of protesters passed by. ""We are talking about the freedom to choose our own president,"" said Oana Eftimie, vice-president of the Patriotic Party of Romanians, another right-wing grouping. One of the peculiarities of the Calin Georgescu phenomenon, is that he seems to have reached beyond existing nationalist parties like AUR, the Alliance for the Union of Romanians, which won 18% and 63 seats in the House of Deputies in the Parliamentary elections on 1 December. Some polls put him as high as 40%. Georgescu has eclipsed both the firebrand AUR leader, George Simion, and the leader of SOS Romania, Diana Sosoaca. Oana Eftimie dismisses the charges against Georgescu, and some of his backers, as reheated slanders: ""He was prosecuted for all that before, and the case was closed last year for lack of evidence. So he's not a fascist, we're not fascists, we're just normal people wanting to be able to choose our leader, and exhausted with those that are in power now."" Romania's cancelled presidential election and why it matters In a quiet flat not far from the noisy marchers, Elena Calistru, president of Funky Citizens, a liberal-minded, non-governmental organisation, admits that the protesters' anguish about a corrupt, complacent elite, has some basis in fact. ""But if you have a house and the roof is leaking. You don't burn down the house. You fix the roof, right? ""Unfortunately for us though, the malaise that we see all over Europe, the lack of leadership, the lack of politicians capable of talking to the general public without trying to compete with the populists, is also present in Romania."" As a loyal US ally, Romanian military analysts are holding their breath over the fate of substantial US military infrastructure in Romania, which includes 4,500 US personnel. ""Dacian Spring"", a major Nato exercise scheduled for the spring, has been postponed until after the May elections. Candidates have until 15 March to register their candidacy for the presidential elections. If the Romanian Constitutional Court rules that Georgescu cannot stand, because of the charges levelled against him, how will the Americans react? US Vice-President JD Vance made an apparent criticism of Romania at the Munich Security Conference last month. ""If your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country then it wasn't very strong to begin with."" ""Now, the good news is that I happen to think your democracies are substantially less brittle than many people apparently fear"", added Vance.

Migrants rescued after several days stranded on oil platform,2025-03-04,Laura Gozzi,"Thirty-two migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean have been rescued by an NGO ship after spending several days stranded on an oil platform off the coast of Tunisia. ""Women, men and children"" were shipwrecked with no food or water, according to Mediterranea, a migrant rescue charity. One person on the platform had died, the charity said. NGO Sea Watch said it had managed to rescue all 32 people from the gas platform on Tuesday afternoon, and that they were being looked after aboard the Aurora ship. However, the Aurora's final destination was unclear as no country nearby had yet assigned the ship a port of safety, Sea Watch said. It added that no European country had intervened ""despite the imminent emergency"" and the fact that the people were stranded in international waters on the border of the Tunisian and Maltese search and rescue (SAR) zones. NGO monitoring aircraft Seabird reportedly spotted an empty rubber dinghy near the platform on 1 March. The shipwrecked people then managed to contact Alarm Phone - an emergency hotline for migrants in trouble at sea. In the call, they said they had been without food for days and that their condition was critical. They also reported the death of one person, Sea Watch said. In a video apparently filmed by one of the people on the platform and shared by NGOs on social media, a young man in a white t-shirt could be heard saying that he and the others were ""suffering from hunger and dying of cold"". Speaking in Tigrinya - a language spoken in Ethiopia and Eritrea - the man said they left Libya five days ago and that the dinghy they were travelling on capsized. ""Those who made it here and didn't die at sea are dying of hunger and exhaustion, if in the few hours nobody does anything we will obviously die... We have only little chance [to survive],"" he said. Behind him were several people apparently shivering from the cold as the waves crashed against the oil platform's pillars. Over 210,000 people tried to cross the Central Mediterranean in 2023, according to data shared by the UN. More than 60,000 were intercepted and sent back to African shores, and nearly 2000 lost their lives at sea. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Father tries to block daughter's euthanasia in landmark Spanish case,2025-03-04,Guy Hedgecoe,"A young woman is due to testify in a Spanish court today in a bid to persuade a judge to let her die voluntarily against the wishes of her father, in the first case of its kind. The 23-year-old woman called Noelia who wants to end her life is paraplegic due to injuries suffered when she tried to take her own life in 2022. She has the support of the regional government of Catalonia after a local euthanasia guarantee and evaluation board unanimously supported her decision in July 2024. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering. It can be involuntary – for example, if a person is in a coma and unable to give their consent – or voluntary, as in this case. The woman was due to die in August, but the process was suspended at the last moment due to legal objections raised by her father, with the backing of the campaign group Christian Lawyers (Abogados Cristianos). ""I want to finish with dignity once and for all,"" Noelia told the court on Tuesday. She claimed to have been ""coerced"" by religious groups and said people had filled a room in the care centre where she was currently living with ""small pictures, crosses and religious symbols"". The Catalan government's legal representation in the case has stated that ""no evidence of a scientific or expert character has been presented to contradict the many medical reports which support the decision [to die]."" However, the woman's father has argued that she is suffering from a personality disorder which affects her judgement and he has pointed to ""the obligation of the state to protect the lives of people, especially the most vulnerable, as is the case with a young person with mental health problems."" He has also said that she has responded well to rehabilitation treatment. His legal representation has also claimed that the young woman has changed her mind about undergoing euthanasia several times. The public prosecutor has not positioned itself with regard to the case, instead calling for the judge to hear the opinions of experts and the woman herself before taking a decision. Among those also due to testify in court in Barcelona today are a member of the euthanasia board which evaluated her case, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist, and a psychiatric specialist. A euthanasia law was introduced in Spain in 2021, but this is the first time that a case has gone to court for a judge to decide. Last year, a magistrate in Barcelona rejected an attempt by a man to appeal against his 54-year-old son's euthanasia after it had been approved by the guarantee and evaluation board.

Trump says he 'appreciates' Zelensky message on Ukraine peace,2025-03-05,Jake Lapham,"US President Donald Trump says he's received a letter from Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to ""come to the negotiating table"" to strike a peace deal in Ukraine. ""I appreciate that he sent this letter,"" Trump said as he addressed a joint session of Congress in Washington. It came after Zelensky said in a social media post that he was ready to work under Trump's ""strong leadership"" to achieve a lasting peace. The statements indicate a cooling of tensions between the leaders following their fiery meeting in the Oval Office last week. In his address to Congress, Trump said he received an ""important letter"" from Zelensky on Tuesday, before reading what he said were excerpts from it. Parts of what he read used precisely the same language as the statement posted by Zelensky earlier on Tuesday. ""The letter reads Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,"" Trump said. Continuing to read from what he said was Zelensky's letter, Trump said: ""My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts."" Trump also said Zelensky told him he was ready to sign a rare earth minerals deal with the US. Ukraine is yet to comment on the letter. The US president also said there had been ""serious discussions"" with Russia, and he'd ""received strong signals that they are ready for peace"". Trump did not indicate when the talks took place, or whether he was personally involved in them. ""It's time to end this senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides,"" he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Zelensky described the White House showdown with Trump as ""regrettable"" in the wake of the US announcing a pause in military aid to Kyiv. Zelensky said ""it was time to make things right"", after Trump had accused him of not being ready to come to the negotiating table. The Ukrainian leader also outlined the first stages of how the war could be ended. The Oval Office meeting between Zelensky and US officials last week was due to conclude with the two parties signing a deal that would grant the US access to rare earth minerals in Ukraine. After the clash, which saw Trump accuse Zelensky of ""gambling with World War Three"", the Ukrainian delegation left without signing the deal. Trump told Zelensky: ""Come back when you're ready for peace."" Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine,2025-03-05,Katya Adler,"""It's certainly one way of focusing our minds — and wallets! Donald Trump is doing us a favour, if we choose to think about it that way. And we may as well look on the bright side. Otherwise these times are too dark."" The words of a diplomat from a major European country, speaking after Donald Trump turned off the military aid tap to Ukraine on Monday. He asked not to be named, so he can share his thoughts more freely. The relentlessness, and pace, of change in Washington, can be dizzying. Not only for consumers of news but politicians as well. Europe is scrambling to react effectively. There has been a frenzy of diplomatic activity: bilateral, late-night leader phone calls, European huddles in London and in Paris, meetings of Nato defence ministers in Brussels. An emergency security summit of EU leaders is also scheduled this Thursday. It is a huge moment in European history. Most European countries believe the security of all of Europe, not only the sovereignty of Ukraine, is at stake — with Russia looking to dismantle the western-facing balance of power, in place since the end of the Cold War. Washington, which has had Europe's back in terms of security and defence since World War Two, now appears ""not to care about the fate of Europe"", according to the man poised to be the next leader of the continent's biggest economy, Friedrich Merz of Germany. But what are all the big-name European meetings and summits actually achieving? Just a few hours prior to Washington halting military aid to Kyiv, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is taking a lead in Europe over Ukraine, announced it was time for ""action not words"". The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, meanwhile, said Europe must turn Ukraine into a ""steel porcupine"", with urgent, extra arms deliveries. Can the continent really act as one, though? Europe is a sum total of different countries with different-sized budgets and diverse domestic politics and priorities. Europe's aim in taking this defence action is two-fold: First, to show Donald Trump that — in the words of the UK prime minister — Europe will now do the ""heavy lifting"" to defend itself. Europe hopes to persuade Trump to restart his military support of Ukraine, and to keep in place the current US security back-up for Europe as a whole, if he believes they are no longer ""freeloading"" off the United States. But also, Europe's leaders will need to urgently boost their own defences and support for Kyiv anyway, if Donald Trump turns away from Ukraine, and further down the line, from Europe more broadly in security terms. It's not only to Washington that Europe feels it has a point to prove. Russia is watching too. The various high-profile, big-pledging European emergency meetings must now produce speedy, impressive, practical results, otherwise in the Kremlin's eyes, Europe looks weak and vulnerable. Moscow has already gloated about the ""splits"" it sees in Western unity. Donald Trump says he trusts Vladimir Putin but he's been scathing about Nato allies and he called Ukraine's president a dictator. Russia knows that, for all Europe's talk about now determinedly defending itself, any security expert you speak to admits that — at least in the short-to-medium term — Europe still needs the US. That is why last week in Washington, we saw the French president and the UK prime minister, separately, wooing Donald Trump. The US has filled the yawning gaps in European defence, left by years of chronic under-investment after the end of the Cold War. The number of troops in Europe diminished with the end of conscription in most European countries. The US has roughly 100,000 troops and nuclear weapons in various parts of Europe under Nato's nuclear sharing policy. Many of them are in non-nuclear, major European power Germany, which fears being severely exposed to Russia should Donald Trump withdraw support. If the UK and France manage to assemble what they call a ""coalition of the willing"" — European countries that accept to send even a modest number of peacekeeping troops into Ukraine once a ceasefire is agreed — that could stretch European armies and expose gaps in Nato defences. That is why Poland is unwilling to commit troops to that ""coalition"". It says it needs to keep soldiers at home, to defend itself against Russia. It also fervently hopes the US won't be pulling its troops out of Eastern Europe. But Europe also relies on the US for military capabilities that ensure the smooth running of operations. These are known as ""enablers"". Ukraine leans heavily on US intelligence, for example, to maintain a strong hand against Russia. But on Wednesday, the Financial Times reported that the US had cut off intelligence-sharing with Kyiv, in a move that could seriously affect the Ukrainian military's ability to target Russian forces. Any European peacekeeping or ""reassurance"" force in Ukraine would need US support to establish an air shield over Ukraine. Europe lacks air-to air refuelling capabilities, as well as munitions that could take out air defences in Russia if necessary. These enablers ""can't be bought in a hurry at the local cash-and-carry"", as one European politician put it to me. This is why the UK, France and others in Europe are so very keen to keep the US on board for as long and as much as possible. ""Some of my esteemed European colleagues should probably hold back from tweeting in anger,"" one frustrated diplomat from a high-profile nation told me. We were discussing European outrage at the treatment of Ukraine's president by the US president and vice-president at the Oval Office on Friday. ""Real leadership is not about letting off steam online. It's about finding the right words to constructively move forward, however complicated the situation. ""Do we need continued US support in Ukraine and Europe? Do we have more in common with the US than with China? Those are the fundamental questions we need to keep in mind."" Another fundamental question for Europe is, of course, how much cash is needed and how fast to credibly boost defence. On Ukraine, Europe could arguably quite easily replace current US support, if it put its mind to it. Germany is the largest donor of military aid to Ukraine after the US. If other European powers followed its lead, it says, Ukraine defence would be covered for the foreseeable future. Berlin and other northern European countries express resentment against France, for example, which they say, talks big about defending Ukraine – and is strong in leadership and strategy - but has in fact donated relatively little. As for broader defence spending, the EU Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen declared on Tuesday that ""Europe is in an era of re-armament"". She suggested the EU alone could mobilise a total of 800bn euros for defence spending by: EU leaders will debate her proposals and others at their summit on Thursday – including whether frozen Russian assets in Europe could be used in funding for Ukraine. But potential and very public European splits loom large. Many fuelled by member states' domestic politics. Hungary, close to Russia and Donald Trump's administration, is a spoke in the wheel of pretty much every EU debate to help Ukraine. Brussels fears Slovakia is going the same way. Countries near Russia's borders do not need to explain to voters why defence spending needs to be high. Tiny, exposed Baltic nations Estonia and Lithuania already spend over 3% of GDP on defence. They want to raise that to 5% in the near future. Meanwhile, big European economies Italy and Spain, geographically much further from Russia, fail to spend the Nato minimum requirement of 2% of GDP on defence. In Germany, France and the UK, according to a study by the London-based Focaldata research group, most voters want to maintain or reduce defence spending, preferring their government to focus on other voter priorities. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte is warning Europeans to wake up and smell the coffee brewing in Washington and Moscow. European nations need to spend more than 3% of GDP now to effectively wean the continent off its deep reliance on the US, he says. If Donald Trump pulls out of Europe altogether, never mind Ukraine, that would mean spending 4-6% of GDP, according to defence experts: a political, social and economic earthquake Europe's leaders hope they will not have to face.

"Pope well-rested after respiratory failure, Vatican says",2025-03-05,Jacqueline Howard,"Pope Francis was well-rested and woke up just after 08:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday, the Vatican said. The Vatican said the Pontiff - who has been in hospital since February to receive treatment for pneumonia - spent the night on ""non-invasive mechanical ventilation"" and is now back on a high-flow oxygen mask. He is free from fever, ""always alert, co-operative with therapies and well-oriented"", the Vatican said in a statement. On Tuesday evening, they had said the Pope was stable after suffering two episodes of respiratory failure the day before. Meanwhile, the Pope's traditional Wednesday audience with Catholics has been cancelled for the third week. The Vatican has published a text instead, but it contains no current references and appears to have been written some time ago. The Pope will also be unable to participate in events planned to mark Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent, the six-week period that leads up to Easter. In Rome, Catholics will take part in a procession to the Santa Sabina Basilica where the Pope would normally attend and say mass. This year the service will be taken instead by one of the Cardinals. He does not have any planned visitors and there is no mention of him doing any work in hospital, even reading, as there was previously. After Monday's episodes, the Pope had begun using an oxygen mask and ventilator to assist his breathing. It was the second time the mechanical intervention had been used, after spending two days on the ventilator following an ""isolated"" breathing crisis involving vomiting on Friday, the Vatican said. In Tuesday's update, the Holy See said Pope Francis had switched back to high-flow oxygen therapy. During the day, he alternated prayer and rest. On Tuesday morning, he received the Eucharist, it added. He has been unable to deliver his traditional Angelus prayer in person on each of the last three Sundays. The 88-year-old was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. Vatican sources stress, as they have all along, that the Pope's condition remains complex – his doctors remain cautious - and he is not out of danger. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Macron floats one-month Ukraine truce: Would it work?,2025-03-03,James Landale,"Could a partial month-long truce between Russia and Ukraine be the key to unlocking a lasting peace between the two sides? President Emmanuel Macron of France believes so and he floated the idea during Sunday's summit of European leaders in London. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, he proposed a four-week truce ""in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure"". It would not cover ground fighting along the front line in the east. ""In the event of a ceasefire, it would be very difficult to verify [a truce] along the front was being respected,"" Macron told the newspaper. In a separate interview, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said: ""Such a truce on air, sea and energy infrastructure would allow us to determine whether Russian President Vladimir Putin is acting in good faith when he commits to a truce. And that's when real peace negotiations could start."" This so far appears more of an idea than a fully worked-out plan and hard details are scarce. But the essence of the hypothesis would seem to divide the process of ending the fighting. An initial short-term truce - something less permanent than a formal ceasefire - would provide a moment to test Russia's willingness to negotiate a peace. It would also potentially give an early political win for President Trump. It would not involve any ceding of territory. And it could create the political space to allow serious talks to begin about a lasting peace. Under the French proposal, a European ""assurance force"" would deploy to Ukraine to deter future Russian aggression only after any lasting ceasefire had been agreed. Britain's Ambassador in Washington, Lord Mandelson, appeared to give credence to the idea on Sunday in an interview with ABC News when he said: ""Ukraine should be first to commit to a ceasefire and defy the Russians to follow."" But on Monday UK government officials and ministers were cool about the French truce idea and emphasised it was not yet an agreed proposal. Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard told the BBC's Today programme: ""A number of options that are being discussed at the moment. None of them have been agreed at this stage"". The prime minister's spokesman said: ""There are clearly a number of options on the table. I'm just not getting into a running commentary on the options."" Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani was more blunt, saying the idea was ""premature"", according to the Italian news agency Ansa. ""I believe that everything must be done together, Europe and United States, sitting at a table with Ukraine and Russia to reach a fair and especially a long-lasting peace,"" Tajani said. ""Therefore, it is still premature to see what to do, how to do it."" There are clearly difficulties with the idea. How would one measure a violation by an anonymous drone attack on a Ukrainian power plant? Why would Ukraine want to give Russian forces a free month to regroup and rearm? But for all that, Western diplomats said the idea of a partial truce was not entirely ""blue-skies thinking"" by President Macron - a man known for floating ideas at international summits. They said it could be part of the European ceasefire plans that are being worked on before being put to the Americans. Clearly some fresh thinking may be needed to try to unlock the current impasse with the US and Ukraine still at odds and the Europeans struggling to find ways of repairing the diplomatic breach. Everything of course depends on what Ukraine and Russia think. On Sunday night Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked if he was aware of the French truce plan and said simply: ""I'm aware of everything."" So far there is no evidence the Russians would be willing to agree to a partial truce. As Zelensky said: ""Anyone who wants to negotiate does not deliberately hit people with ballistic missiles.""

"A weekend of frantic talks - where does it leave Zelensky, Trump and Europe?",2025-03-03,Laura Gozzi,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is back in Kyiv after three frantic days - which began with him being ordered to leave the White House following a tense and public showdown with Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday. He found a warmer welcome in London on the weekend, where he was greeted by the prime minister outside Downing Street, visited the King, and received a strong show of support from European leaders at a summit on Sunday - a sharp contrast to the scenes in the Oval Office. After the London summit, Sir Keir Starmer suggested European leaders would form a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine - but details of who would contribute what were scarce. Here's the latest on Zelensky's relationship with Trump, and Europe's plans to guarantee Ukraine's security. In a series of social media posts on Saturday morning, President Zelensky said Ukraine and the US needed to be ""honest and direct with each other"" to understand their shared goals - and he wanted America to ""stand more firmly"" on their side. Appearing on Fox News hours after leaving the White House, Zelensky said the confrontation was a ""really tough situation"" and took the chance to thank Americans and Donald Trump. He also stopped short of an outright apology despite calls from US lawmakers for him to do so. While Trump hasn't commented directly on the angry exchange over the weekend, most Republican figures have expressed their support for Trump and Vance. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz - who was in the Oval Office during Friday's heated meeting - compared the Ukrainian leader to an ""ex-girlfriend"", while Speaker Mike Johnson called for Zelensky to quit. However, moderate Republican Nebraska Congressman Don Bacon said it was ""a bad day for America's foreign policy"" and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski said she is ""sick to my stomach as the administration appears to be walking away from our allies and embracing Putin"". Posts on social media in support of Zelensky poured in shortly after he left the White House on Friday evening. Among the notable exceptions were Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who wants to preserve her excellent relations with the Trump administration, and Hungary's Viktor Orban, who praised Donald Trump for ""standing bravely for peace"". By the time the London summit came around on Sunday, there was a sense that concrete action had to follow words of support – with most leaders careful to highlight that they still considered US support essential. At the end of the summit, Starmer outlined a four-point plan for peace which included the continuation of military aid to Ukraine, a commitment for Ukraine to be present at peace talks, boosting Ukraine's defence capabilities to deter future Russian aggression, and developing a ""coalition of the willing"" to defend Ukraine, including sending troops to Ukraine. Starmer said that the idea of sending troops to Ukraine - which would include boots on the ground and planes in the air - had the backing of several parties, but he was careful to leave it to individual countries to discuss the matter internally. Scandinavian countries have already signalled they would be open to the idea. Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said she was keeping an ""open mind"" on the proposal, while Sweden's Ulf Kristersson said his country was ready to provide Ukraine with security guarantees – if it had the backing of the US. Italy's Giorgia Meloni would much rather push for another summit that includes the US than discuss a European contingent in Ukraine – a possibility which she says ""perplexes"" her. And Poland – which has long been one of Kyiv's most vocal supporters – has already ruled out sending soldiers, although it put few boundaries on humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. European leaders will now have a few days to digest the latest developments before they meet again in Brussels on Thursday for a special meeting on defence, at which Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen will present what she has called ""a comprehensive plan on how to rearm Europe"". On Sunday night, the French newspaper Le Figaro reported that President Emmanuel Macron and Starmer have proposed a potential one-month truce between Russia and Ukraine, ""in the air and at sea"". Details of any agreement are scarce and the idea put forward by the French remains just that. Under the hypothesis, both sides would agree a truce for four weeks in the air, on the sea and around energy infrastructure. But, Macron has suggested it would not cover fighting on the ground along the front line, as it would be too hard to monitor. But on Monday morning, the UK's armed forces minister played down the idea of a truce insisting that ""no agreement has been made on what a truce looks like"". Luke Pollard told Times Radio: ""We are working together with France and our European allies to look at what is the path to how... we create a lasting and durable peace in Ukraine."" Any truce would have to be agreed by Russia and there is no evidence yet they are willing to do that. Although Vladimir Putin has not yet officially commented on the Washington encounter, the Kremlin's foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it had been a ""complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv"". On Monday morning, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov then added his criticism of the London summit on Ukraine. ""Statements were made there about the need to step up funding for Ukraine as a matter of urgency. This is obviously not part of a peace plan but is done to continue the fighting,"" Peskov said. ""The rest will depend on what kind of peace plans will be drawn up and offered for discussion. Any constructive support for this process would be welcome now, and any constructive initiatives."" Remarking on the response to the war more broadly, Peskov also suggested that ""the collective West has partially begun to lose its collectivity"". Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Swedish police investigate suspected water pump sabotage,2025-03-03,Mallory Moench,"Swedish police are investigating a suspected sabotage incident on a water pump on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. Police told the BBC that the local government's water unit received an alarm for a water pump on Sunday at 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT). ""Technicians found that someone has opened an electrical cabinet, pulled out a cable and thereby cut off the power to the pump,"" police said. The technician put the cable back and reset the alarm at 21:30 local time, and the pump is now working. Police have not said who they suspect could be responsible. The incident comes after the suspected sabotage of an undersea telecoms cable connecting Germany and Finland last month. There has been an increase in damage to infrastructure in the Baltic Sea in recent months, largely caused by ships dragging their anchors across cables. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error have been found to be responsible for some damages. Following the discovery of the suspected sabotage on Gotland on Sunday, Patrik Johansson, who heads the local water and sanitation department, said: ""We can see that it is human influence that caused the damage."" There has been no impact on the drinking water, the statement added. Susanne Bjergegaard-Pettersson, Gotland's head of water and sewage, earlier on Monday told Aftonbladet, which first reported the incident, that the water pumps drew from a lake that supplies large parts of the island. Bjergegaard-Pettersson later told the BBC she could not provide information about how many people got their water supply from the pump. Gotland is a large island in the Baltic Sea that sits to the east of mainland Sweden and west of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Zelensky bruised but determined after diplomatic whirlwind,2025-03-03,Laura Kuenssberg,"""Bruised but motivated,"" was how one of Volodymyr Zelensky's entourage described how they had been feeling, as a small group of journalists crammed into what felt like an even smaller room at Stansted Airport. The British state had done its best to give the Ukrainian president ""all bells and whistles"" when he arrived in the UK for a summit with 18 world leaders after his dressing down by Donald Trump and JD Vance on Friday night, a government source told me. He shared an embrace with Sir Keir Starmer outside No 10, where he was greeted with spontaneously cheering crowds, and met with King Charles for tea. But it was telling that in the 90 minutes before his plane's wheels went up as he heads back home, Zelensky wanted to go on the record to make his arguments to the world - this time speaking only in Ukrainian - to make sure he was not misunderstood. Having been slammed in the White House, then feted in the UK, his mood, in public at least, was not downhearted. ""If we don't keep our spirits up, we're letting everyone down,"" he said. He made positive noises about Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron's plan to grab hold of the plans for peace before presenting them to the US, for Europe to up its game, developing its own more convincing security guarantees. Zelensky told me he would be prepared to give Donald Trump one of his demands - to sign the minerals deal that would give the US access to some of Ukraine's resources. Beyond that, despite all the pressure of a three-year war, under all the demands from the White House which, fairly or not, has the power to protect or abandon his country, on Sunday night Zelensky stood firm. He told us it was wrong at this stage to discuss giving up territory Russia has captured, and it was too early to be ""talking about lines"", which the prime minister had mentioned earlier. He would not apologise to Trump or express regret for anything that happened in the Oval Office, which at the moment, the US president's camp is repeatedly calling for. Even the boss of Nato called for Zelensky to find a way to reset his relationship with the US leader. Yet in the stuffy room at Stansted, there was not much in Zelensky's tone that suggested he was interested in making nice. He said he had travelled for hours to get to the White House - his visit was a mark of respect. He also said he would never ""insult anybody"" and the conversation as it erupted had not been a positive for anyone. Zelensky chose his words very carefully. He tried to an extent to avoid a post-mortem of what went on. He was not rude about Trump - he barely mentioned him by name - and suggested tensions would pass. If you watched the full horror of what happened in the Oval Office you may well not blame Zelensky for feeling it's simply not for him to say sorry. If you listen to him talk about what has happened to his country, you can understand why it feels so impossible at this stage for him to acknowledge compromises might have to come to end the war. Watching him in person talk about the violence and the suffering that has been unleashed, you sense his total disbelief that anyone might not see the world his way, where Russia's aggression means Putin must not be spared punishment, and his people should be protected at all costs. But the reality? Neither Zelensky nor any Western leader so far has persuaded Trump to adopt that moral clarity on this war. And even if it's painful, without a willingness to compromise, it's hard to see an end to this war. Zelensky is though, a master communicator - genuine, doubtless, but also a performer by trade. ""Our freedoms and values are not for sale,"" a message of no surrender Zelensky wanted to communicate, along with a willingness to sign the minerals deal. He again expressed his thanks for the backing of the US and other countries. But don't forget right now, for all of the encounters we have with the leaders involved in public, there are so many more between them and their teams behind closed doors. Just when our conversation was coming to an end, a suggestion that Macron and Sir Keir were proposing a month-long truce as part of their plan for peace reached my phone. Did President Zelensky know and would he agree such a deal, I asked. ""I am aware of everything,"" he joked, getting a laugh in the room, then offering handshakes and photos on his way out to the plane. He may have wanted to have had the last word at the end of a dramatic and difficult weekend. But the conversation about this conflict has many weeks, if not many months to run.

The difficult choices facing Ukraine's Zelensky,2025-03-04,Paul Kirby,"Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky is in a bind. After last Friday's disastrous meeting in the Oval Office, it seems nothing that he says goes down well with President Donald Trump. And now the US has suspended aid to Ukraine, his options are looking increasingly thin. Even a former close Republican ally in the US, Senator Lindsey Graham, has turned on him, suggesting ""he either needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change"". What kind of change might that be - or should he resign if that's the price of US support? This option seems Zelensky's most likely way out and Ukraine's prime minister now says Kyiv is open to talks on signing a minerals deal with the US. Trump told Zelensky point-blank on Friday he was not in a very good position: ""You don't have the cards right now - with us you start having cards."" Zelensky had been ready to sign-off on the minerals deal with Trump on Friday before he was told to leave the White House. That particular card appears to have remained on the table, and on Monday night Zelensky's chief aide Andriy Yermak said he was working on it with Republican Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick and the deal was ""crucial for both our countries"". But clearly the Trump administration is holding out for more. Zelensky cannot afford to be humbled into an abject apology. After three years of Russian bombardment, Ukrainians are not in the mood for capitulation. But he would have to find a form of words sufficient to appease Trump. He might also have to accept a ceasefire on Trump's terms, even if he still believes peace is ""very, very far away"". Would the deal mean a resumption of aid and to what extent? Certainly that's a priority for Kyiv. The head of parliament's foreign affairs committee, Oleksandr Merezhko, says suspending US aid is dangerous for Ukraine's ability to defend its own civilians. Falling on his sword is not something Zelensky will or can consider. Trump has called him both unelected and a dictator, echoing Vladimir Putin's Russian propaganda narrative since the start of the war. Zelensky said on Sunday night it seemed ""a bit undemocratic"" for Ukrainians to be told who should be their president. He is after all Ukraine's elected leader, and although his term was meant to end last year, he remains president under martial law, which came into place precisely because of Putin's Russian invasion. It would be a great result for Putin, who has sought to replace Zelensky since the start of the war and will not even talk directly to him ""because of his illegitimacy"". But the only way Zelensky would consider it would be in exchange for Nato membership for Ukraine, and Trump has said he should forget about that. Several Ukrainian figures made clear on Tuesday they would hold out for as long as necessary without US aid, but some reports suggest the US pause has halted critically important air defence missiles and artillery. Ukrainian MP Fedir Venislavskyi told local media that they could last about six months, but only the US could provide them with air defence systems and long-range multiple rocket systems. Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says Ukraine is already producing about a third of the weapons it needs, and its goal was 50%. So could Zelensky rely on European allies instead? European nations have collectively paid out substantially more than the US in aid to Ukraine, and the head of the European Union's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has announced plans to beef up Europe's defence capability. She is proposing up to €800bn in defence funding - some of which would also go to helping Ukraine. But the EU and UK are adamant that US security guarantees are vital in the event of a ceasefire, even if in Sir Keir Starmer's words ""it is right that Europe do the heavy lifting"". Denis Shmyhal himself describes concrete US guarantees as ""existentially important"" for Ukraine and the entire continent. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

What pause in US military aid could mean for Ukraine,2025-03-04,Jonathan Beale,"President Donald Trump's decision to pause all US aid to Ukraine is a bitter blow – not just for Kyiv but also European allies who have been lobbying the US administration to continue its support. This is not the first time that the US has withheld military aid. Republicans in Congress blocked then-President Joe Biden's largest tranche of military assistance for Ukraine in the summer of 2023. Then, Ukraine just about managed to eke out its existing stocks of ammunition with the help of Europe. Congress finally approved the £60bn aid package in the spring of 2024. It was just in time - Ukraine was struggling to fend off a renewed Russian offensive in Kharkiv. The arrival of the delayed US weapons helped turn the tide. As in 2024, it may be months before the effects of cutting off US aid are felt – at least in terms of ammunition and hardware. European nations have slowly ramped up their production of artillery shells. Overall Europe now provides Ukraine with 60 percent of its aid – more than the US. However, US military support is still vital to Ukraine. One Western official recently described it as ""the cream"" in terms of weapons.  Ukraine's ability to protect its people and cities has heavily relied on sophisticated US air defence systems – such as Patriot batteries and NASAMS – jointly developed with Norway. The US has given Ukraine the ability to carry out long range strikes – with HIMARS and ATACM missiles. The US has limited their use inside Russia, but they have still been vital to hit high value targets inside occupied territories. It is not just quality, but quantity too. As the world's most powerful military, it has been able to send hundreds of surplus Humvees and armoured vehicles - numbers that smaller European armies could never match. The absence of some of this aid may take time to filter down to the frontline. But there could be a more worrying immediate impact, not least in terms of intelligence sharing. No nation can match the US in terms of space-based surveillance, intelligence gathering and communications. And it is not just provided by the US military, but commercial companies too. Take Elon Musk's Starlink satellite communication network. Every Ukrainian position I have visited on the frontline has a Starlink dish. They are used to relay the latest information on the battlefield. They have been essential to co-ordinate artillery and drone strikes. In the past, the Pentagon has admitted that it has been funding this lifeline. Given that Elon Musk is a key figure in the US administration, it seems highly unlikely that he will now be willing to foot the bill. He too is a harsh critic of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Will the US prevent European countries from sending their US-made equipment to Ukraine? When Europe wanted to provide US-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine, it first had to receive the approval of Washington. And then what about the maintenance of US-supplied equipment? The US has also been training Ukrainian forces and then helping them maintain US-supplied equipment. Biden lifted restrictions on US contractors working in Ukraine towards the end of his term. F-16 jets in particular need engineers and spares to keep on running. Trump's decision to pause aid may, to many in Ukraine and beyond, seem petulant. But there is also clearly a political aim to force them to the negotiating table sooner. The hope among European allies is that it will just be a pause. Without US support, Ukraine will find it an even harsher struggle for survival. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

What hurdles does Europe's peace plan for Ukraine face?,2025-03-03,Frank Gardner,"Whatever words are used to frame the plans emerging from Sunday's summit of 19 mainly European leaders in London - ceasefire, truce or peace plan - the challenges ahead are enormous. The UK's Prime Minister Keir Starmer, along with French President Emmanuel Macron, hope this will be the plan to eventually bring lasting peace to Ukraine. At its heart lies what Sir Keir is calling the ""coalition of the willing"", those who would help to guarantee peace in the event of a deal being reached. But what are the hurdles – and how easily can they be overcome? First, can Europe's depleted armies and half-empty arsenals muster anything approaching a substantial deterrent force to deploy to Ukraine? What nations, other than the UK and France, will be willing to send forces into such an uncertain scenario given the doubts over US support? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said it would need an international force of up to 200,000 troops to sustain a ceasefire along the 600 mile (960km) line of contact between the two opposing armies, Russia and Ukraine. Although that figure is wildly optimistic, the Ukrainian leader is correct in assessing just how many would be needed to act as a sufficient deterrent to any future Russian incursions. In reality, Europe will struggle to come up with even a third of that number, such is the effect of decades of running down its militaries, years after the post-Cold War peace dividend should have ended. Air power would be crucial. This is both for what is known as ISR [Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance] and for repelling any future Russian incursions. There is no point having a brigade of UK troops sitting on part of the notional ceasefire line if thousands of Russian troops and armoured vehicles are pouring through a gap 100 miles away and there is no adequate means to repel them. The US has a huge capability in Signals Intelligence, Sigint, as well as air-to-air refuelling, without which a purely European force would struggle. A recent report by the London-based think tank the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) stated: ""Europe's reliance on Washington's military capabilities, especially critical enablers such as ISR and air-to-air refuelling, will make pursuing 'independence' a major challenge without major investment in those areas."" It goes on to say that: ""The US also contributes over half of all Nato's fighter and fighter ground attack aircraft."" In short, putting together a credible deterrent force to protect Ukraine would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, without US military backup. Donald Trump likes to say that he doesn't start wars, he stops them. The last thing he wants to do right now is to commit US combat troops and air power to a notional unstable ceasefire line which has the potential to erupt into a shooting war that drags in Nato forces. Instead, he has telegraphed his preferred way to end this war, which is to cut a deal direct with Russian President Vladimir Putin, one-on-one. Sir Keir's aim is for Europe to come up with a credible ceasefire proposal which can then be presented to President Trump in the hope - and I would emphasise that word ""hope"" - that he then agrees to provide a US military backstop. So far, that looks unlikely. Why on earth would it? - some would argue. Its ground forces are winning on the battlefield, albeit at a horrendous cost in human lives and Ukraine has all but lost its greatest ally in this war: the US. Without America's military support, Ukraine will be hard-pushed to hold back advancing Russian troops in the east and south-east. Without US Patriot missiles, its cities will be even more vulnerable to mass missile attacks by Russia. President Putin has always made it clear he will not accept the presence of Nato member troops in Ukraine. Now that he effectively has an ally in the White House, he is even less likely to give way on this point unless President Trump can offer him a major inducement in return. The bottom line in all this is that the Kremlin has not given up on its maximalist aims for Ukraine which is to eventually bring the whole country back into Moscow's orbit, replacing Zelensky with a pliant, pro-Russian puppet. At the bare minimum, it is unlikely to budge on its core demand that Ukraine permanently cede not only those territories Russia already occupies - in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk and Luhansk regions - but also gives up the adjacent cities of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, forcing hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian residents to either flee or become Russian.

Planes are having their GPS hacked. Could new clocks keep them safe?,2025-03-03,Pallab Ghosh,"As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion. The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by ""GPS signal interference"". This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank – though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory. The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill. To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are. Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks. The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at £1.4bn each day – no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats. With this in mind, a group of British scientists – dubbed the ""Time Lords"" – has been asked to come up with a solution. The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself – all within a few years. In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking – and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent. The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration. Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem – and the impact could be at least as transformative. ""History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,"" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London. In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation. The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation. The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison. But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices. ""We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,"" he says. ""So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced."" Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the ""Time Lords"" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium. GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab. The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves. When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis. ""The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,"" she tells BBC News. The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time. Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over – though that would take longer. ""To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,"" says Prof Paul. Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. ""The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,"" he says. ""There is no guarantee GPS … will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it."" While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as ""further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum"". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and ""the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged"". By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming. But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes. Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, ""where there's a bit more space"". Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around £100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems. GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons. ""We are harnessing atoms,"" she points out. ""You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed"". The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones. This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going. QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone. That process isn't going to happen soon, though. ""This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,"" says Prof Paul. Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship – his greatest difficulty was to make it small. But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea. ""Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,"" says another DSTL scientist. ""As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity."" Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong. Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough? One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy – transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.

'Trump and Vance were so rude': Ukrainians react to disastrous White House meeting,2025-03-01,James Waterhouse,"Whether or not President Volodymyr Zelensky was ambushed or should have been more diplomatic in the Oval Office, it was a disastrous visit for Ukraine. For those watching in Kyiv, the future of their country hung in the balance. ""It was an emotional conversation, but I understand our president,"" Yulia tells me next to Kyiv's golden-domed St Sofia's cathedral. ""Maybe it wasn't diplomatic, but it was sincere. It's about life, we want to live."" Yulia reflects a political pattern in Ukraine: the more the country is attacked, the more unity there is. Before the full-scale invasion in 2022, President Zelensky's trust rating was 37%. Afterwards, it rocketed to 90%. Before Donald Trump returned to office at the start of 2025, it was 52%. After he blamed Ukraine for starting the war, it hit 65%. ""They [Donald Trump and JD Vance] were so rude,"" says 30-year-old Andriy. ""They don't respect the people of Ukraine."" ""It looks like Washington supports Russia!"" observes Dmytro, 26. You wonder what the last 24 hours has done to President Zelensky's popularity. ""When the situation becomes worse, we have another rallying around the flag,"" explains Volodymyr Paniotto, director of the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology which conducted some of the polling. World leaders' popularity often wanes over time, and Mr Paniotto says President Zelensky has not been immune. His ratings especially took a hit with Ukraine's failed counteroffensive of 2023, and his sacking a year later of the popular commander in chief of his armed forces, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi. But Donald Trump's new, transactional, often-hostile approach to Ukraine has forced the country to unite and brace for further uncertainty. Not least with his warming to Russia. The initial reaction was that of shock,"" says opposition MP Inna Sovsun. ""It was difficult to watch a president who's been a victim of Russian aggression being attacked by the leader of the free world,"" she adds. ""It's painful."" Ukrainian TV channels reported yesterday's scenes in a more measured way: that a minerals deal between Ukraine and the US was simply not signed. Perhaps, given it didn't include the American security guarantees that Kyiv and Europe desperately want, it wasn't as tantalising for Zelensky as had been suggested. ""We need to find stronger allies in Europe and Canada, Australia and Japan, who've all been supporting us,"" argues Sovsun. There are clearly deep feelings of resentment between Washington and Kyiv. However, Sovsun doesn't think Ukraine should give up on negotiations, but should instead reframe the debate. ""It's important to find the right mediator,"" she says. ""Someone Trump can recognise, but someone we trust too. Someone like Georgia Meloni of Italy. ""Under no circumstances should we agree to calls for the president to resign, and I'm saying that as an opposition MP. That defies the very idea of democracy."" President Zelensky hoped his Washington visit would lead to a deeper co-operation with the US which could, in turn, bring a lasting peace. Something Sovsun thinks nobody wants more than Ukrainians. ""We are the ones who are suffering, it's extremely difficult to live under this stress,"" she adds. ""Just this morning, I read that my friend's son was killed, his second son in this war."" What the MP and countless Ukrainians don't want is a rushed settlement. Attempted ceasefires with Russia in 2014 and 2015 only allowed Moscow to prepare for its full scale-invasion years later. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsyntsadze anticipated a second Trump presidency being less sympathetic to her country's cause, but not to this extent. ""This mineral agreement does not oblige America to help us militarily, or to upscale or continue the support it's currently giving,"" she says. While there is still parliamentary unity behind President Zelensky and suspended elections, MPs like Klympush-Tsyntsadze have been calling for more involvement in negotiations. Her European Solidarity Party's chairman is former President Petro Poroshenko, a fierce rival to Zelensky. He was even recently sanctioned by Ukraine's leader over what Ukraine's security service labelled as ""threats to national security"" and ""creating obstacles to economic development"". Mr Poroshenko said it was ""politically motivated"". Despite this, the former president said he recognised Zelensky's legitimacy as leader, to combat both American and Russian claims to the contrary. As sirens wail and missiles slam into cities, this is a war still raging, despite all of the talk of ending it. Russia is not backing down on its demands for Ukraine's political capitulation and the complete control of four regions. ""This war is not for some area, town or treeline in the east,"" says Taras Chmut, head of the Come Back Alive foundation. After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, the organisation was set up to crowdsource military equipment for fighting Ukrainian troops. ""This is the war that will define the world order for future decades. Whether this world will still exist depends on how this war goes,"" he says. As he ruthlessly pursues his ""America First"" policy, Trump wants Europe to provide security on a continent where he is less willing to do so. But Europe is divided on this, and where there is agreement it is that peace is not possible without the US as a safety net. ""Europe and the world once again want to close their eyes and believe in a miracle, but miracles do not happen,"" says Mr Chmut. ""Countries must accept the reality of the situation and do something about it. Otherwise, you will be the one to disappear next - after Ukraine.""
